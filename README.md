This is a mirror of the Localytics iOS SDK so you can git submodule it
into your project.

The latest production version will always be on the *master* branch and
specific versions will be on their own branches. 

If you happen to notice that we don't have the latest version, please
open a ticket or send us a pull request and we'll get it updated right
away.
